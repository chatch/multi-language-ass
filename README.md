# multi-language-ass
Merges two [ASS subtitle files](https://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/subtitles/ssa.html) with different languages into a combined ASS file so you can have 2 sets of subtitles on your film at once.

One language is displayed at the bottom and one on the top as defined by styles
in the ASS file.
